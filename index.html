                <h2> Affiliate Marketing </h2>
                <p> Affiliate marketing is a method of 
                    earning online by promoting people's 
                    products, which means a product owner 
                    will give his/her product to you as an
                    affiliate marketer to sell, the after
                    selling it you'd get 50% of the price
                    you sold the product for. Let's assume
                    the product price is 20k if you sell one
                    of it you'll get 50% which is 10k, and note
                    you're not the owner of the product you'd 
                    only sell and make money without stress☺️☺️
